What is Pseudocode 

It is a simplified, high-level representation of an algorithm that uses plain English and programming-like constructs to describe the logic.
 It is an informal and contrived way of writing programs in which you represent the sequence of actions and instructions(algorithms) in a form that humans can easily understand.

Why and when we use it?

When you're writing code in a programming language, you’ll have to battle with strict syntax and rigid coding patterns. But you write pseudocode in a language or form with which you're very familiar.

Since pseudocode is an informal method of program design, you don’t have to obey any set-out rules. You make the rules yourself.

Pseudocode acts as the bridge between your brain and computer’s code executor. It allows you to plan instructions which follow a logical pattern, without including all of the technical details.

Pseudocode is a great way of getting started with software programming as a beginner. You won’t have to overwhelm your brain with coding syntax.

In fact, many companies organize programming tests for their interviewees in pseudocode. This is because the importance of problem solving supersedes the ability to ‘hack’ computer code.

You can get quality code from many platforms online, but you have to learn problem solving and practice it a lot.


How to write pseudocode to represent algorithm?

Pseudocode is not a programming language — it’s a structured way to describe an algorithm in plain, human-readable
steps before coding.

Steps to Write Pseudocode:

Understand the Problem
Clearly define the input, process, and output.

2. Use Simple Language
Write in plain English (or your preferred language) with logical flow.

3. Follow a Structured Format
*Use indentation to show hierarchy.
*Use keywords like START, END, IF, ELSE, WHILE, FOR, etc.

4. Be Language-Independent
Avoid syntax from any specific programming language.

5. Keep It Clear and Concise
Each step should be easy to understand.


Example of problem algorithm written in pesudocode?

Example Problem:

1 "Write an algorithm to find the largest number among three given numbers."

Pseudocode:


Copy code
START
    INPUT num1, num2, num3

    IF num1 >= num2 AND num1 >= num3 THEN
        largest ← num1
    ELSE IF num2 >= num1 AND num2 >= num3 THEN
        largest ← num2
    ELSE
        largest ← num3
    ENDIF

    OUTPUT "The largest number is", largest
END


2. Binary Search

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.

BEGIN BinarySearch
INPUT: Array ARR, Value X
SET LOW = 0, HIGH = length(ARR) - 1
WHILE LOW <= HIGH DO
SET MID = (LOW + HIGH) / 2
IF ARR[MID] == X THEN
RETURN MID
ELSE IF ARR[MID] < X THEN
SET LOW = MID + 1
ELSE
SET HIGH = MID - 1
ENDIF
ENDWHILE
RETURN -1 // Element not found
END
